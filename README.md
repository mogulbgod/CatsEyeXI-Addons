This is a repo of custom Ashita 4 addons for the CatsEyeXI server.

STFUApu
Blocks the server messages sent by "Apururu" and not the Unity chat like if you were to try and use the filters. Also some players said the filters don't work for them and some say it does but it didn't work for me so I made an addon to do that.

Type /stfuapu help or /apu help for a list of commands. Can also display the DI server message in a simplified single line of text (/stfuapu simple on).
